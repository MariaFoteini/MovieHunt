# Enriching the Demo of SPARQL-QBE over Movies with Images

This project enhances the front-end demo of a SPARQL-QBE (Query By Example) system for querying movie databases by integrating movie poster images and additional metadata from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. The goal is to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface, improving usability and engagement for both expert and non-expert users.

## Key Features
- Integration of the TMDb API to fetch movie posters, ratings, genres, and release dates.
- Implementation of lazy loading to optimize performance and reduce page load times.
- Modern front-end technologies, including JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, HTML5, and Bootstrap, for a responsive and interactive design.
- Enhanced user experience with dynamic data fetching and improved navigation.
